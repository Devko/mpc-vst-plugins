# A fake device is a shell script that builds the device's files inside the container: MPC.settings (the real format,
# trimmed), plugin folders, a stub systemctl. FS_ANY=1 lets the container's overlay filesystem count as internal storage.
# Add one for your model (copy its MPC.settings layout from the device.txt the plugin writes) and send it with your PR.
